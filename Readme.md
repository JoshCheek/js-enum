=============

Address `Gusto 1201 16th St #350`

* Students develop confidence in using map, reduce and filter on an Array in JS
* Students understand the purpose of an index when enumerating
* Students understand how to enumerate over the properties of an Object
* curl / curl -i / jq . / pbcopy

High Level Wishes:

Students should get a chance to see someone dig in deep into a fundamental section of JavaScript -
mostly it's just been a tool to get things on the page for them.
The more absurdly into the weeds the lesson gets, the better, in my mind.

Students are getting rapidly interested in using LoDash -
which to me is a sign that they are feeling really uncomfortable in manipulating data.

It would be neat to teach this from the standpoint of working with API data -
[api.github.com](https://api.github.com)

They were supposed to get [this](https://github.com/mdn/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck)
lesson, but they went through it on their own and prob fucked around instead.


Maybe options
-------------

* API
  [x] - curl output into a file
        then they can read it from the file (faster / doesn't look like DDOS)
        then we can give them
        filter github events and grab all the commits
        https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/events/public
  [ ] - Same as 1, but the data they're working with will come from a repo
        that we set up for the tests
  [ ] - Same as 1, but Romeeka will **react** to it ;)~
* Test suite of functions (inputs / outputs) that require development
  of these skills (Katrina style -- maybe even just translate a
  subset of her work?)
