* Students develop confidence in using map, reduce and filter on an Array in JS
* Students understand the purpose of an index when enumerating
* Students understand how to enumerate over the properties of an Object

High Level Wishes:

Students should get a chance to see someone dig in deep into a fundamental section of JavaScript -
mostly it's just been a tool to get things on the page for them.
The more absurdly into the weeds the lesson gets, the better, in my mind.

Students are getting rapidly interested in using LoDash -
which to me is a sign that they are feeling really uncomfortable in manipulating data.

It would be neat to teach this from the standpoint of working with API data -
[api.github.com](https://api.github.com)

They were supposed to get [this](https://github.com/mdn/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck)
lesson, but they went through it on their own and prob fucked around instead.
